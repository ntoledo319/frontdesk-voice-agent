"""Dialogue state machine for the intake call.

The agent walks the caller through the missing lead fields one at a time,
confirms the captured details, and finishes. Extraction is pluggable: the
default is the offline rule-based parser from ``intake``, and an LLM-backed
extractor (see ``llm.py``) can be injected without changing this machine.
